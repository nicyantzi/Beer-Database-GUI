Application I built using Eclipses Application Design Tools to query & update a database containing various customers, employees, beers and transactions (both b2b & b2c). 

Java GUI using SWIFT and JFrames. 

Built for a project in COMP421 Databases Course at McGill. Database is hosted on a McGill University Network though so VPN is required. 

BeerDatabaseAccess.jar is a runnable jar file. 

All other files in the repo are source code/image files.
